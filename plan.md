# Aperture Enterprise: Automated Remediation + Verification

## Phase 4: Exploit Intelligence + Proof Collection ✅ COMPLETE

All exploitation intelligence capabilities have been successfully implemented.

---

## Phase 5: Automated Remediation + Verification Engine

**Objective:** Build a closed-loop, self-healing security orchestration system with automated remediation, continuous verification, immutable evidence generation, and AI-driven optimization.

---

## Phase 5A-D: Core Remediation & UI ✅ COMPLETE

Core remediation engine, database schemas, and initial UI placeholders are complete.

---

# Phase 6: Evidence-Based Validation & Trust Center

**Objective:** Implement an evidence-based validation framework to measure and improve model accuracy, track performance, and build trust with users through transparent dashboards.

---

## Phase 6A: Validation & Performance Tracking

**Goal:** Create the backend services and database tables required to track prediction accuracy and framework performance over time.

- [ ] **Create `validation.py` Page:**
    - Build a new page at `/validation` titled "Validation & Tuning Hub".
    - Add a button to "Run Validation" and display a "Last Run" timestamp.
- [ ] **Create `ValidationState`:**
    - Implement `load_validation_data` to fetch historical validation records.
    - Define data structures: `ValidationRecord`, `FrameworkPerformance`, `AutoTuneEvent`.
    - Add `is_loading` state and `last_run_time`.
- [ ] **Implement UI Components:**
    - Create `accuracy_gauge` to show `overall_accuracy`.
    - Create `performance_trends_chart` to display `accuracy_trend` data.
- [ ] **Database Schema (`validation_migration.py`):
    - Create `validation_results` table to store ground truth comparisons.
    - Create `framework_performance_metrics` to store daily accuracy/precision/recall.
    - Create `auto_tuning_history` to log automated weight adjustments.

---

## Phase 6B: Trust Dashboard & Error Analysis

**Goal:** Build the UI components for the Validation Hub that display performance metrics and allow for error analysis.

- [ ] **Implement Framework Comparison Matrix:**
    - In `validation.py`, create a table to display `performance_metrics` (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) for each framework (CVSS, EPSS, etc.).
- [ ] **Implement Error Log Viewer:**
    - Create a data table to display `error_logs` (incorrect validation records).
    - Show `cve_id`, `predicted_score`, `ground_truth_score`, and `error_margin`.
- [ ] **Implement Automated Tuning Panel:**
    - Add a UI section to manage the `auto_tuning_enabled` state with a switch.
    - Display the `tuning_history` in a table.

---

## Phase 6C: Human-in-the-Loop Feedback System

**Goal:** Integrate a user feedback system directly into the UI to capture ground truth and enable a continuous learning loop.

- [ ] **Create `FeedbackState` (`feedback_state.py`):**
    - Implement `submit_feedback` and `undo_feedback` event handlers.
    - Add state variables: `is_submitting`, `feedback_for_finding`.
- [ ] **Integrate Feedback Panel into UI:**
    - In `finding_detail_panel.py`, add a "Human-in-the-Loop Feedback" section.
    - Display buttons for "Confirm Exploitability" and "Mark as False Positive".
    - Show existing feedback and provide an "Undo" option.
- [ ] **Database Schema (`feedback_migration.py`):
    - Create `feedback_labels` table to store user-provided ground truth.
    - Create `model_retraining_queue` table to trigger retraining jobs based on feedback thresholds.
